# Fortran Tank strategy game

2D stationary tank combat game

Based off of https://github.com/lounsbrough/fortran-tank-game
Adapted to use modern Fortran techniques, but is still not completely modern style.
I just did enough to make it 100x faster at grid generation and functionalized it.

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
